    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Climate change refers to significant alterations in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. Driven largely by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, it poses serious threats to ecosystems and societies. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss are some of its alarming consequences. The effects are being felt worldwide, from melting polar ice caps to severe droughts in arid regions. Immediate global action is crucial to mitigate further damage and ensure a sustainable future.
